📖 Project Overview Smart Academic Dashboard replaces scattered college systems with one clean portal. Students can view their attendance, download study materials, check exam results, and track their timetable. Faculty can mark attendance, upload resources, publish exam marks, and monitor student performance. HODs can oversee their entire department — students, faculty, attendance, and exam results — and send notices to faculty members. Key highlights:

Single login page with automatic role-based redirection Students self-register with password strength validation Faculty and HOD accounts created by Super Admin Real-time notifications when resources are uploaded or marks are published HOD notice board — send notices to all or specific faculty Downloadable attendance reports in Excel and marks reports in PDF Low attendance warning system — alerts students below 75% Fully responsive design — works on desktop, tablet, and mobile

hod_year_1 → Manages Semester 1 & 2 students hod_year_2 → Manages Semester 3 & 4 students hod_year_3 → Manages Semester 5 & 6 students hod_year_4 → Manages Semester 7 & 8 students

A HOD can be assigned multiple year groups simultaneously. Login Redirect Logic javascriptif (role === "student") → /student/home if (role === "faculty" && is_hod) → /hod/home if (role === "faculty" && !is_hod) → /faculty/home

🧪 Testing Guide Admin Setup

Go to http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/ Create Department: Computer Science (CS) Create Faculty user: role=faculty, create FacultyProfile with employee ID Create HOD: same as faculty but check is_hod=True and check year group boxes Create Subjects: DS601, CN602, OS603, WT604 — Sem 6, CS dept, faculty assigned Register Student: go to /register, fill Sem 6, CS, Section A Create Section: Name A, Sem 6, CS — add student to Students field Add Timetable entries for each subject on different days

Testing Password Restrictions Go to /register → Step 1 → type in password field:

abc → Very Weak, all red ✗ Abc1@123 → Very Strong, all green ✓ Mismatched confirm → red border with ✗ Matched confirm → green border with ✓

Testing Faculty Flow Login as faculty → Mark attendance → Upload resources → Create exams → Enter marks → Download Excel/PDF Testing Student Flow Login as student → Check home charts and low attendance warning → View attendance with recovery calculator → Download resources → Check marks Testing HOD Flow Login as HOD → Check overview stats → View students list → View faculty → Check attendance overview → View exam results → Send notice to all faculty Testing Notices HOD sends notice → Login as faculty → Go to Notice Board → Notice appears with pulsing amber dot → Click to expand → Marks as read automatically → Bell notification also appears

🔒 Security Notes

DEBUG = True — development only, set False in production CORS_ALLOW_ALL_ORIGINS = True — development only, restrict in production SECRET_KEY — change and store as environment variable in production JWT tokens in localStorage — suitable for college project demo File uploads stored locally — use cloud storage in production

🧩 Known Limitations

SQLite — not suitable for high-traffic production No email verification on registration No forgot password via email Notifications use polling (30 seconds) instead of WebSockets Pillow may have issues with Python 3.14 on Windows — use Python 3.11/3.12

🚀 Future Enhancements

Dark mode toggle Assignment submission system Email notifications for low attendance PostgreSQL for production WebSocket real-time notifications Docker containerization Mobile app with React Native
